<h1>ðŸ§  Problem Statement</h1></br>
Banks face increasing risk when lending to unqualified customers. The goal of this project is to develop a risk analytics system that helps financial institutions make smarter decisions on loan approvals based on historical banking behavior and customer profiles.
</br>
<h1>ðŸ’¡ Solution Overview</h1></br>
This project processes and analyzes relational banking data to:
</br></br>
<li>Assess loan default risk</li>
<li>Segment clients by income and engagement</li>
<li>Track and visualize key KPIs</li>
<li>Support real-time loan decision-making through dashboards
</br></br>
The entire pipeline uses:
</br></br>
<li>Excel for initial data exploration</li>
<li>Python for data cleaning and feature engineering</li>
<li>MySQL for relational data querying</li>
<li>Power BI for KPI dashboard development</li>
</br>
<h1>ðŸ’» Technologies Used</h1>
</br>
<li><strong>Power BI </strong> â€“ Interactive dashboards and data visualizations</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong>â€“ Data extraction, joins, and aggregations
<li><strong>Python (Pandas, NumPy)</strong> â€“ Preprocessing and custom metric creation
<li><strong> Excel </strong>â€“ Early-stage data analysis and profiling
</br>
